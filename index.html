    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I was born in Maryland, and have lived there my whole life. I went to a high school called "St. Maria Goretti Catholic High School",
        but unfortunately, following the 2024 school year they were forced to close. A hobby of mine that I really enjoy is baseball. I have
        been playing for a while now, and I still play here for the Division 3 team. I also like to spend time with friends.
